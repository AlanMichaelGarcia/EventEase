GitHub Repository
You created a GitHub repository for your project, enabling version control and deployment.

Event Card Component (Copilot Assisted)
Copilot generated the foundational EventCard component in EventCard.razor with fields for title, description, and date, using two-way data binding and validation.

Routing Functionality
Routing was implemented and debugged. The navigation menu (NavMenu.razor) includes links to all main pages, including Events, Register, and Attendance.

Performance Optimization
Input validation was added to forms and the Event Card to prevent invalid data. Routing errors were addressed by ensuring correct navigation and updating the base href for GitHub Pages deployment.

Advanced Features

Registration Form with validation: Implemented in Register.razor using Blazor’s form components and data annotations.
State management for user sessions: UserSessionService in UserSessionService.cs tracks registration and attended events, registered as a scoped service in Program.cs.
Attendance Tracker: Attendance.razor displays the user’s registration info and attended events. Users can mark attendance for events directly from the Event Card.
Copilot Assistance Summary
Copilot was used to:
Scaffold the Event Card and Registration Form components.
Add validation and two-way binding.
Implement state management and attendance logic.
Update navigation and deployment settings.
